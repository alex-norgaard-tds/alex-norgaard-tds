## Hi there 👋

I'm Alex. 
DevOps Engineer extraordinaire - or so I like to believe.

I like working with Python 🐍, Docker 🐳 and automation 🧩 in general.

Since I like Python and automation, here's a silly little project to show it off:-  
This file was last generated automatically on the `##DATETIME`  
(it allegedly updates [every hour, on the 15th minute](.github/workflows/update.yml#L5))

<summary>Why the 15th minute?</summary>
Well, GitHub Actions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule">officially state</a> that there is high load at xx:00, and to schedule your actions at a different time if precision is your goal.

> The `schedule` event can be delayed during periods of high loads of GitHub Actions workflow runs. High load times include the start of every hour. If the load is sufficiently high enough, some queued jobs may be dropped. To decrease the chance of delay, schedule your workflow to run at a different time of the hour.
